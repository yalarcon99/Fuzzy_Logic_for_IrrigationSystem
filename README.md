# Fuzzy Logic Algorithm for Irrigation System
Design of a Fuzzy Logic system with multiple crisp inputs obtained through the OpenWeatherMap API for the computation of the humidity reference for a control based on the reference. Algorithm developed by Yithzak Alarcon and Marcela Arrieta under the supervision of prof. Dr. Jose L. Villa R, for the purpose of publication at CIIMA.
